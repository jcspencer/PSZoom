Enabling RClone will allow the script to sync the local recording archive
to Sharepoint once it has finished a download.

This requires:
- A SharePoint site to be created for the organization
- A service account with write access to the site to be ready

We are able to configure RClone to build a configuration file locally,
treating the SharePoint site as a WebDAV destination, and then export
that configuration to be used when the script is run.

To set up RClone:

Download RClone for 64-bit Intel/AMD from https://rclone.org/downloads/
(https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.52.0/rclone-v1.52.0-windows-amd64.zip)

Extract the RClone archive to a folder called 'rclone' in the script directory.

Now, in the terminal:

$ cd path\to\script\folder

$ .\rclone\rclone.exe config

n) New Remote
